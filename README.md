# JAVIS the Iron Man's Assistant

J.A.R.V.I.S is a "Voice-Only Assistant" refers to a type of digital assistant or artificial intelligence system that primarily interacts with users through voice commands and responses, without relying heavily on visual interfaces or screens.

## How it work?
- **Step 1: Speech Recognition:**
   - Listening to human voice, then recognizing those human voice and transforming it into a sequence of text
- **Step 2: Text-to-Text (Sequence-to-Sequence) Generation:**
   - Sending that text (supposing to be a human conversation) as an input into a LLM, like OpenAI's GPT or any open-source LLM's (through APIs).
- **Step 3. Speech Synthesis:**
   - The output from Step2 (the sequence of text output from the LLM) to be transformed into speech.
